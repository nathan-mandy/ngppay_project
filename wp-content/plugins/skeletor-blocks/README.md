Skeletor Blocks
===============
This plugin adds an abstract class called `Skeletor_Block` to your theme. By extending this class, you can quickly create your own custom Blocks, with lots of easy-to-use hooks for advanced customization.

This plugin users VitalMustache to render, so make sure you have that installed too!

Skeletor Cheat Sheet
--------------------
A Skeletor Block is going to have two basic parts:  
- A PHP Class that extends `Skeletor_Block` in theme/includes/blocks  
- A Mustache view in theme/views - the filename should be the the static $name from the php class  

And optionally if you need custom css/js for the block  
- An scss file in theme/assets/src/styles  
- A js file in theme/assets/src/js
